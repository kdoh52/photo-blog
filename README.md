The Memories photo blog is a responsive web application that allows users to sign in and post images with captions, hashtags, and titles. Users can also like posts and edit their own if they wish. This application includes user authentication, third-party APIs, and database models. This project was guided by JSM.

## Overview and Technologies

This is a MERN Stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Authentication is implemented using JSON web tokens and Bcryptjs. 

Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas are used to create User and Post models which make up the majority of the website interaction. Redux is used in tandem to provide state management on the front-end.

The application's styling is done primarily with Material UI.
